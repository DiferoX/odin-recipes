    <p>While many of your favorite fast-food drive-thrus are open for takeout during the coronavirus pandemic, should you really be eating fast food during the coronavirus? Experts say it's OK, but there are some precautions you'll need to take. Instead of risking it outside the house, you can still eat your favorite copycat fast-food recipes from the comfort of your home.</p>
    <p>That's why we've rounded up recipes that flawlessly mimic your guilty pleasures but won't require you to leave the house.</p>

      <!--Recipe 1-->

      <li><h2>Copycat McDonald's Big Mac</h2></li>
      <img src="images/big-mac.webp" alt="Copycat McDonald's Big Mac">
      <p>There are two main issues with the Big Mac as it stands: The quality of the ingredients is subpar, and the middle bun is absolutely superfluous. We replace the mystery meat with lean ground sirloin, sear it in a cast-iron skillet until beautifully browned, then bring the classic ingredients together inside a single, squishy sesame seed bun. It's one of our favorite copycat recipes to date.</p>

      <li><h2>Copycat Domino's Deluxe Pizza</h2></li>
      <img src="images/pizza.webp" alt="Copycat Domino's Deluxe Pizza">
      <p>While our version of sausage pizza is slightly different, we have a feeling you'll love this homemade pizza as much as you love the Domino's version. Domino's Deluxe Pizza includes pepperoni, Italian sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms, and onions. Our pizza still has Italian sausage and peppers, but we lighten it up on the meat by skipping on the pepperoni and add spinach instead.</p>

      <li><h2>Copycat KFC Fried Chicken</h2></li>
      <img src="images/fried-chicken.webp" alt="Copycat KFC Fried Chicken">
      <p>We'll be the first to admit that the idea of oven-fried chicken rubs us the wrong way. Usually, the chicken comes out dry and the crust soggy or non-existent, leaving your need to eat crispy, juicy food unfulfilled. But this version of the oven-fried chicken recipe defies all expectations. The result? The juiciest, crispiest oven-fried chicken ever.</p>
