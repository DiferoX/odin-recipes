        <p>We'll be the first to admit that the idea of oven-fried chicken rubs us the wrong way. Usually, the chicken comes out dry and the crust soggy or non-existent, leaving your need to eat crispy, juicy food unfulfilled. But this version of the oven-fried chicken recipe defies all expectations. First, the chicken is brined in buttermilk and hot sauce, then it's coated in bread crumbs that have been tossed in a gentle amount of oil. The result? The juiciest, crispiest oven-fried chicken ever.</p>

        <br><br>
        <h2>YOU'LL NEED</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 chicken drumsticks</li>
            <li>4 cups non-fat buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp hot sauce (preferably Frank's RedHot pepper sauce)</li>
            <li>2 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp canola or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic salt</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        <h2>HOW TO MAKE IT</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the chicken, buttermilk, salt, sugar, and hot sauce in a sealable plastic bag and shake to combine. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, use your fingers to break up the panko bread crumbs into slightly smaller pieces (this will help create a more even coating on the chicken).</li>
            <li>Add the oil, chili powder, and garlic salt and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Working with one piece at a time, remove the chicken from the marinade, shake off the excess liquid, then toss in the bread crumbs until thoroughly coated.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken pieces on a rack set in a rimmed non-stick baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake on the middle rack of the oven for about 30 minutes, until the bread crumbs are evenly browned and the chicken is cooked through.</li>
            
        </ol>
